# Seal clubber
Seal clubber is a web app for a game called [World of Tanks](https://worldoftanks.eu/) in which user can ingame statistics and tank information.
World of Tanks has a lot of statistics and values some of which are hidden to the player and can only be
accessed via World of Tanks official API. A lot of players including me are interested in knowing these values and also statistics which can tell how well is the player performing or how well should one perform.
